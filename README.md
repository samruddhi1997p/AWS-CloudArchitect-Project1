# Data durability and recovery

In this project created highly available solutions to common use cases. Built a Multi-AvailabilityZone, Multi-Region database and show how to use it in multiple geographically separate AWS regions. Also built a website hosting solution that is versioned so that any data destruction and accidents can be quickly and easily undone.
